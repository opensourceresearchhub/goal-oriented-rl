1-) RL-States-To-Actions.ipynb : The architecture used here takes an input state and a desired state as inputs, and outputs an estimated average action that takes the agent from the input state to the desired state. This file contains the code for running this architecture on OpenAI's Gym's Cartpole-v1 or MountainCar-v0. The score was decent on Cartpole, but bad on MountainCar. Both have not been solved using this architecture yet.

2-) RL-States-To-Actions-Sequences.ipynb : The architecture used here takes an input state and a desired state as inputs, and outputs an estimated sequence of actions that takes the agent from the input state to the desired state. This file contains the code for running this architecture on OpenAI's Gym's Cartpole-v1 or MountainCar-v0. It can be easily extended to other Gym games. The score was decent on Cartpole, but bad on MountainCar. Both have not been solved using this architecture yet.
